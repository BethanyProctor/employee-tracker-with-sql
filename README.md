# Employee Tracker with SQL
  Created by Bethany Proctor 

  ## Description
  This project allows employers to quickly and easily view and update information about their employees, the roles they play, and the departments they manage. This is a simple CLI tool powered by Inquirer. The biggest challenge I faced during the creation of this project was connecting to the database (in this case I used DBeaver) and making sure that everything was working both there and in the app itself.
